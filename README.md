<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project, we recreate the game TicTacToe to play in a browser using Javascript. This game is for two players, who take turns for adding the marker 'X' or 'O' in spaces of a 3Ã—3 board. The player who first places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
